2A.1
 Bundles 
A 
bundle
 is the default logical construct for archiving digital data in the PDS.
 (Recall that 
terms 
such as bundle, collection, and basic product are defined in the glossary of the 
PDS4 Concepts
document.) 
Bundles have a simple hierarchical structure.  A bundle has one or more member 
collections
, 
each of which has one or more member 
basic
products
 (Figure 2A-1).  PDS does not impose 
requirements on how bundles are defined except that (1) bundles must be distinct (their 
LIDs/LIDVID
s must be distinct) within the overall holdings of PDS, and (2) each bundle must 
be approved by a PDS peer review. 
Fig
ure 2A-1: Archive structure. 
Members of a bundle are listed in a Product_Bundle, an XML file which serves as both a label 
and the bundle inventory.  Product_Bundle is described and uniquely identified using the 
Product_Bundle class definition (see Section 9D for information on constructing 
Product_Bundle).   
An optional “readme” file may be included as part of Product_Bundle; it is described by the 
bundle label so is not a separate product.  The “readme” file provides a general overview of the 
bundle contents and organization in human readable format.  
It may also contain general 
instructions for use of the bundle and contact information for data provider or discipline node 
personnel.  The “readme” file must be formatted either as 7-
bit ASCII text o
r as UTF
-8 text
.

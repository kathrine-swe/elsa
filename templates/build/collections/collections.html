2A.5 Collection Types
Basic products must be organized into collections based on the type and function of the data.  
Data providers are expected to assign products to appropriate collections (e.g., only ‘quick-look’ or ‘browse’ products are expected to be assigned to a browse collection); the assignments will be considered during peer review.  PDS recognizes the following types of collections. 
    <li>browse</li>
        {% block more_info_block %}
A 
browse
 collection contains ‘quick-
look’
 products designed to facilitate use of the archive.  
Products in a browse collection are defined using appropriate classes; possibilities include 
Product_Browse and Product_Thumbnail. 
        {% endblock %}


    <li>calibration</li>
        {% block more_info_block %}
A 
calibration
 collection contains data and files necessary for the cali
bration of basic products.  
Products in a calibration collection are defined using the appropriate class; possibilities include 
Product_Observational and Product_Document.
        {% endblock %}


    <li>context</li>
        {% block more_info_block %}
A 
context
 collection is the list of products comprising various
 objects
, identified within the PDS4 
registry
, that are specific to the science bundle.  
These include physical objects such as 
instruments, spacecraft, and planets and conceptual objects such as missions and PDS nodes.  All 
products in a context collection will be secondary m
embers of the collection, since the primary 
versions are curated by the PDS Engineering Node
 or other responsible agency
. 
        {% endblock %}


    <li>data</li>
        {% block more_info_block %}
A 
data
 collection
 contain
s observational products
, often separated according to processing level, 
target, instrument mode, etc
.; these
 are the science data that most users seek.  Products in a data 
collection will typically be defined using the Product_Observational class.
        {% endblock %}


    <li>geometry</li>
        {% block more_info_block %}
A 
geometry
collection contains non-
SPICE geometry products — for example, Supplementary 
Experiment Data Record (SEDR) data, 
gazetteers
, tables of anaglyph pairs, or footprint files
.  
Detailed information about particular cartographic projections utilized in the archive may also be 
included.  Products in a geometry collection are defined using an appropriate class; possibilities 
include Product_Observational
, Product_Ancillary, and Product_Document.
        {% endblock %}


    <li>miscellaneous</li>
        {% block more_info_block %}
A 
miscellaneous
 collection
 contains supplementa
ry information deemed by the data provider to 
be useful in
 the interpretation
 and use
 of other collections
 in the bundle but which does not fit 
within the scope of the other collections
.    For example,
 meta
-data catalogs,
 data bas
e dumps, and 
records of modification history
 could be included. 
Because of the disparate nature of the files 
included in a
 miscellaneous collection
, no single class exists for miscellaneous products.  T
he 
following are some of the possibilities: Product_Ancillary, Product_Document, 
Product_File_Text, Product_Observational, Product_Thumbnail, and Product_Zipped.
        {% endblock %}

    <li>XML schema</li>
        {% block more_info_block %}
An 
XML schema
 collection contains all XML schema files included in or referenced by XML 
labels in the bundle along with any Schematron files created for validation purposes.  A bundle is 
required to contain an XML schema collection unless all of the collection members would be 
secondary in which case the XML schema collection becomes optional. There can be no more 
than one XML schema collection per bundle.
        {% endblock %}

    <li>SPICE kernels</li>
        {% block more_info_block %}
A 
SPICE
 kernels
 collection contain
s individual SPICE files
 and their XML labels
, organized by 
kernel type.  Product
s in a SPICE kernels collection must be
 defined using the 
Product_SPICE_K
ernel class.
